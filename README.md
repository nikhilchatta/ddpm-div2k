# DDPM-DIV2K

This repository contains the implementation of a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) trained on the DIV2K dataset for high-quality image generation.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

DDPM is a generative model that learns to reverse a diffusion process that gradually adds noise to the data. This project adapts DDPM architecture using a custom lightweight UNet and trains it on the high-resolution DIV2K dataset.

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikhilchatta/ddpm-div2k.git
   cd ddpm-div2k
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed)**
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

---

## ðŸ“¦ Training

Run the training script:
```bash
python Main.py
```

Update your training configurations from `modelConfig` dictionary inside `Main.py`.

---

## ðŸ–¼ Sampling

After training, generate images:
```python
generate_one_batch(
    model_path="./Checkpoints/final_model.pt",
    save_dir="./SampledImgs/batch_1",
    batch_size=64,
    image_size=128
)
```

---

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

The following image quality metrics have been implemented:

- PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
- SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)
- MS-SSIM (Multi-Scale SSIM)
- LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity)
- Perceptual Similarity (VGG Feature Distance)
- FID (FrÃ©chet Inception Distance)
- IS (Inception Score)
- KID (Kernel Inception Distance)

All metrics are evaluated over 20 rounds and averaged.

## âš™ Tools & Frameworks

- Python
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- scikit-image
- scipy
- pytorch-msssim
- lpips
- Git LFS

## ðŸ“Œ Note

Some files such as sample images and data may be large. Git LFS is used for storing large files. Ensure `git lfs pull` is used after cloning.
